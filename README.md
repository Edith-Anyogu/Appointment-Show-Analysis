# Appointment-Show-Analysis
In this analysis I will be analysing the no show appointment dataset, that contains infomation about patients medical history in Brazil. In addition I will explore the data to find out variables that may be influencing a patients decision wether to show up for their hospital appointment or not to show up.

> I will be analysing how demographic variables like Age and Gender influence appointment show. I will also analyze how patients medical conditions affect appointment show.

 ## Research Questions:
 1. What Gender is more likely to show up for scheduled appointment?

2. Are patients more likely to show up for appointment on a particular month?

3.  Is a patient more likely to show up for their appointment if they receive a reminder about their appointment? 
4. Is a patients medical condition likely to influence if they will be on scholarship and show up for their appointment?
